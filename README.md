# My homepage

When browsers were first invented your homepage was the first page that the browser opened. It often containted a list of useful links. Later when people got the ability to make their own pagesthat were permanently on the internet it became place to put personal information that you wanted to share with the public. Yahoo started off as a well maintenained homepage containing a heirarchical index of links.

Browsers still have the ability to set a url a homepage. Safari opens this URL when you create a new tab whereas Chrome only brings it up when you press the "home" icon next to the url on browsers UI.
