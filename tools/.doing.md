**Tool Description: dot_doing.py**

`dot_doing.py` is a command-line utility designed for scanning a directory tree to find and aggregate `.doing.md` files—Markdown files intended to help track ongoing tasks or projects. The tool produces a single consolidated Markdown file, `doing.md`, that serves as an index of all found `.doing.md` files, complete with their contents and metadata.

### Key Features:

1. **Directory Scanning**: The tool recursively scans a specified directory (or the user's home directory by default) and identifies `.doing.md` files while respecting a configurable list of directories to ignore, such as version control directories or build folders.

2. **Validation**: It validates found `.doing.md` files to ensure they follow specific formatting rules, such as starting with a level-3 heading (`###`) and not containing higher-level headings. Any formatting warnings are collected for the user's reference.

3. **Caching Mechanism**: To enhance performance, the tool uses a caching system to store previously found `.doing.md` files in a JSON file (`doing_files.json`). Users have the option to ignore the cache and perform a full scan if needed.

4. **Markdown Generation**: After processing the found files, the utility compiles a summary Markdown file, `doing.md`, which includes:
   - An index with timestamps of the last modifications for each `.doing.md` file.
   - Each file's content, organized with clickable links for easy navigation.
   - A section dedicated to warnings, listing any formatting issues discovered during the validation phase.

5. **User-Friendly CLI**: The tool provides a simple command-line interface using the `click` library, making it straightforward to execute and configure through command-line options, including the ability to set the root directory for scanning and ignore the cache.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: It supports major operating systems—Windows, macOS, and Linux—for opening files with their default applications.

### Use Cases:

- **Task Management**: Ideal for developers and project managers who keep track of ongoing tasks across multiple `.doing.md` files in visually organized structure.
- **Documentation**: Useful for Markdown-based documentation, providing a central reference for document updates and modifications.
- **Organization**: Helps maintain clean project directories by allowing users to quickly aggregate content from various `.doing.md` files while ignoring clutter from irrelevant directories.

By generating a single, comprehensive Markdown file from scattered `.doing.md` files, `dot_doing.py` is a powerful tool for improving workflow and project tracking.
